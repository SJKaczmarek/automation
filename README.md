# Automation Scripts
This repository contains various small scripts that I have written to automate my day-to-day activities. Some of these were written as part of some other project but can be easily re-used with minor modifications and hence have been added here.

# License
These scripts are protected under the Apache license. These scripts are free for personal use. You may modify them as you want as long as the modification is valid under the Apache license.
I am willing to make exceptions to the licensing rule on a case-by-case basis. Please email me for such requests.
